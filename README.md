Project 1: Creating a Unit Converter

In this project, you will create a Python Program that:
1. Allows user to choose what kind of unit conversion he/she wants to do.
Examples of unit conversion are: temperature in Farenheit to Celcius, weight in Pound to Kg, distance in Feet to Meter, etc.
Your program should have at least 5 different options for user to choose
3. After user chose one of the unit conversions (e.g., temp), the program asks user for quantity in one unit (temp in F) and the program prints out quantity in another unit (temp in C).
The program then repeat step 1 until user enter 0.
Then program stop and print a nice goodbye message to the user.
Sample output:

Enter task 1: temp, 2: weight, 3: distance (0 for quit): 3
Enter distance in feet: 3
3.0 feet is 0.9144000000000001 meter
Enter task 1: temp, 2: weight, 3: distance (0 for quit): 2
Enter weight in pound: 1
1.0 pound is 0.453592 kg
Enter task 1: temp, 2: weight, 3: distance (0 for quit): 1
Enter temperature in f: 2
Enter task 1: temp, 2: weight, 3: distance (0 for quit): 1
Enter temperature in f: 2
2.0 f is -16.666666666666668 c
Enter task 1: temp, 2: weight, 3: distance (0 for quit): 0
